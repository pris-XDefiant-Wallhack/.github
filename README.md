## 👻 What is Wallhack in XDefiant?

Wallhack is a cheat that **renders enemy models or outlines through solid objects** — walls, crates, cars, even smoke. It doesn’t aim or shoot for you, it simply **shows you where every enemy is at all times**, making it perfect for pre-aiming, flanking, or staying one step ahead.

Pair it with a good headset and some IQ plays, and you’ll look like a literal ESP god with "insane map awareness."
